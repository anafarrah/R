#Importing Data in R
# 5 types of data: 

#flat files

#Data from excel

#Databases

#Internet

#Statistical Software

#.csv ~ comma seperated values
#.tsv ~ tab seperated values

#read.csv

#readr
    install.packages("readr")
    library(readr)
# skip  ~ specifies the number of lines you're ignoring in the flat file before actually importing data
# n-max ~ specifies the number of lines you're actually importing
#collectors ~ collector functions can be passed in a list

#data.table: fread (think of it as a better read.table)

#say you have 5 variables but you only want to keep the first and fifth named "a" and "e"
    fread("path/to/file.txt", drop = 2:4)
    fread("path/to/file.txt", select = c(1,5))
    fread("path/to/file.txt", drop = c("b", "c", "d"))
    fread("path/to/file.txt", select = c("a","e"))
